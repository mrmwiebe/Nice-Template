#NICE TEMPLATE

A responsive SCSS template I use for basic websites based on the [Bones for Wordpress layout](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones).  I generally use the fantastic CodeKit to parse all the SCSS automagically for me and incorporate jQuery and Bootstrap.

Mostly here for my own use, but if you find any of it helpful, all the better. :)
